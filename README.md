## Whitecliff Castle and the Thousand Doors

This is a program I strung together over the course of a weekend out in Cambria, CA. It takes an array of Room objects (thought of here as vertices), each with a corresponding number of Doors (edges), and randomly assigns different Rooms to different Doors. Or, in other words, it creates vertices randomly between the edges wherever possible until it has finished. 

I've also added NPC mobility and save functionality, but those were added relatively haphazardly and it shows in the code.
